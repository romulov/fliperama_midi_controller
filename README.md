Lack of access to technological devices is a common exponent of a new form of social exclusion. Coupled with this, 
there are also the risk of increasing inequality between developed and underdeveloped countries when concerning
technology access. Regarding Internet access, the percentage of young Africans who do not have access to technol-
ogy is around 60%, while in Europe the figure is 4%. This limitation also expands for musical instruments, whether
electronic or not. In light of this worldwide problem, this paper aims to showcase a method for building a 
MIDI Controller, a prominent instrument for musical production and live performance, in an economically viable form
that can be accessible to the poorest populations. This equipment can be also suitable for teaching various subjects 
such as Music, Computer Science and Engineering. The outcome of this research is not an amazing controller or a brandy 
new cool interface but the experience of building a controller concerning all the bad conditions of doing it.
